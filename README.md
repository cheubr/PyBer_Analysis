## PyBer Analysis Results

    Looking at the summary data frame, Urban rides are the majoirty. The ammount of rides doubles the other two city types combined. The average fare per ride is the lowest, and per driver. The app is deffinately mostly used in Urban city types. The city type generates a consistant $2000 weekly. The suburban city type is used regularly but not as frequently as the urban city type. In the rural areas the service is not used very frequently. Some weeks not even $100 dollars worth of fares are acumulated. Althought the average cost of the fares in the rural areas are higher, the volume is low. This could be because in rural areas the distances of each ride are farther. The average duration and distance of each trip would be helpful to give more insight.

    Looking at the graph we can infer rides are most popular during the winter (Jan to Feb) and there is a signifigant drop toward the end of Feb / early March. This trend happens accross all three ctiy types. The suburban areas have the largest decresee in rides of all three, nearly 30%.
